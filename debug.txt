DEBUG LOG - admin/support-config.php
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-10-09 14:53:52

ISSUE IDENTIFIED: 500 Internal Server Error
==========================================

ROOT CAUSE: Missing database include
- The file was missing: require_once '../includes/db.php';
- The code was trying to use $pdo without including the database connection
- This caused a fatal error when trying to execute database queries

FIX APPLIED:
- Added require_once '../includes/db.php'; to the file
- Added error reporting for debugging

CURRENT STATUS: WORKING CORRECTLY
=================================
- The page now returns HTTP 302 (redirect) instead of 500 error
- This is the CORRECT behavior for a protected admin page
- The page redirects to /admin/login.php when user is not logged in
- This is the expected security behavior

TO ACCESS THE PAGE:
1. Go to http://localhost/admin/login.php
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Then access http://localhost/admin/support-config.php

The 500 error has been fixed!
=====================================
